/**
 * Client-side conversion events for the TEGO pixel (`tego.js`, loaded in the
 * root layout with `data-slug="cole-hocker"`).
 *
 * Convention shared across TEGO client sites:
 *  - `form_submit` fires ONLY after the server confirmed the submission, once
 *    per submission, with a stable kebab-case `formId` and a human `label`.
 *  - NEVER put PII (names, emails, phones, free text) in the event data.
 *  - Never fires on /admin.
 *  - Primary CTAs carry `data-tego-cta="<name>"`; tego.js sends those clicks
 *    itself, so no listeners here. tel:/mailto: links are auto-tracked too.
 *
 * Optional-chained on purpose: an ad blocker or a slow script load must never
 * break a form that already succeeded.
